    "\n",
    "Ecological competitions offer a fairly reliable tool for measuring the robustness of a strategy, but it is still insufficient. It is possible, for example, that some strategies may sacrifice themselves for others in a *master-slave* scheme. Having a synthesis of hundreds or even thousands of ecological competitions in which certain strategies have been removed probably measures a better robustness. One of the simplest ideas is to calculate the `n` possible competitions that can be done by removing 1 strategy from a set of `n` strategies. This technique is called the subclass technique.\n",

    "- `subclasses(soup, n)` which evaluates all possible subsets of size n in the soup\n",
    "- `subclassesWithOneStrat(soup, n, strat)` which evaluates Strat in all possible subsets of size n in the soup by systematically adding the strategy strat\n",
    "- `subclassesRandomWithOneStrat(p, soup, n, Strat)` which organizes competitions of n randomly selected strategies in the soup in which Strat has been syst√©matically added\n",
