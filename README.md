In this repository there are 3 jupyter notebooks in Python which contain both explanations and exercises on this field. Their objective is primarily pedagogical.

## Game Theory

English : [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/cristal-smac/ipd.git/master?filepath=EN/gametheory_en.ipynb)

In this Jupyter notebook we explain the basics of game theory concerning simultaneous games, including payoff matrix notion and the different equilibrium notions. In this notebook the prisoner's dilemma is just one example among many.

## The Iterated Prisoner's dilemma

We focus now on the famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game which is the iterated version of the previous one. Strategies can now learn from the past. We show how to build a strategy and especially how to evaluate it. Several sets of objective strategies are provided.

## Machine learning for the IPD

In this Jupyter Notebook we show how to use "machine learning" technics to identify and produce new efficient strategies, mainly genetic algorithms.
