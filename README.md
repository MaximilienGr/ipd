In this repository there are 3 jupyter notebooks in Python which contain both explanations and exercises on this field. Their objective is primarily pedagogical.

## The Prisoner's dilemma
see `gametheory.ipyb`

In this Jupyter notebook we explain the basics of game theory concerning simultaneous games, including payoff matrix notion and the different equilibrium notions. The prisoner's dilemma is just one example among many.
## The Iterated Prisoner's dilemma
see `prisonersdilemma.ipynb`

We focus in this Jupyter Notebook on the famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma Game which is the iterated version of the previous one. We show how to build a strategy and especially how to evaluate it. Several sets of objective strategies are provided.

## Machine learning for the IPD
see `ipd_machinelearning.ipynb`

In this Jupyter Notebook we show how to use "machine learning" technics to identify and produce new efficient strategies.
